# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-21)

**Core value:** Every call is permanent, public, and tied to identity. The receipt — created, settled, and shared — must be unfakeable, undeletable, and visually unmistakable.
**Current focus:** Phase 00 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 00 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 5
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-21

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Spec source-of-truth: `CALL_IT_SPEC1.md` v1.0 locked at 3,088 lines; REQ-IDs in REQUIREMENTS.md are translation, not redesign
- Roadmap derived from spec §19 plus 5 research deltas: Phase 0 added (always-live foundation); Phase 1.5 runs parallel to Phase 2 (social linking); Solidity baseline rep delta ships in Phase 4 not Phase 5; multisig promotion pulled into Phase 6 as hard gate; subgraph + OG service skeletons in Phase 0 with finalization in Phase 7
- Solidity pinned to exact `=0.8.30` (NOT `^0.8.24`) to avoid 0.8.28–0.8.33 IR storage-clearing bug; CI grep guard enforces
- USDC hardcoded to canonical `0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831` (NOT bridged USDC.e); CI grep guard enforces single source-of-truth
- Stylus 48h-before-demo cutoff is mechanical `proxy.upgradeTo(soliditySolidityBaselineAddress)` (one cast call), not a panicked rewrite — baseline ships in-contract from Phase 4
- [Phase ?]: 00-01 deviation: @privy-io/wagmi pinned to 4.0.8 (v1.32.5 specified in CLAUDE.md does not exist on npm)

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Operational budget items the spec is silent on (~$175/mo recurring + ~$150-300 upfront): X API Basic tier ($100-200/mo), The Graph publishing GRT (~$100-300 upfront), Pinata ($20/mo), Redis ($5/mo), Better Stack ($25/mo), Pyth update VAA ETH (~$10/day at 1000 settles). Pre-deploy budget approval needed before Phase 6 mainnet promotion.
- Top 3 inherited risks: Stylus alpha-line crate stability (`openzeppelin-stylus@0.3.0`), X API Basic tier ongoing cost volatility, owner-resolved disputes as governance attack surface (mitigated in v1 via Phase 6 multisig + public dispute log + owner self-exclusion).
